Sure! Here's a detailed explanation of the provided C++ code:

### Overview

The code is a simple utility designed to:
1. **Read words from a text file**.
2. **Count the occurrences of each word**.
3. **Track the line numbers where each word appears**.
4. **Save the word counts and line number occurrences to separate output files**.

### Class Definition

#### `WordCounter` Class

The `WordCounter` class handles the reading of the input file, processing of the word data, and writing results to output files.

- **Member Variables**:
  - `inputFile`: The name of the input file, which is fixed as `"input.txt"`.
  - `wordCounts`: A map where keys are words and values are their frequencies.
  - `wordLines`: A map where keys are words and values are sets of line numbers where the word appears.
  - `sortedWords`: A vector of pairs (word, count) used to store and sort words by their frequency.

### Member Functions

1. **Constructor (`WordCounter()`)**:
   - Calls `processFile()` to read and process the input file.
   - Calls `prepareWordList()` to sort words by their frequency.

2. **`processFile()`**:
   - Opens the input file and reads it line by line.
   - For each line, it increments a line number counter.
   - Uses a `std::set<std::string>` to keep track of unique words on the current line (ignoring duplicates on the same line).
   - Updates `wordCounts` to keep track of how many times each word appears.
   - Updates `wordLines` to track the line numbers where each word appears.

3. **`prepareWordList()`**:
   - Transfers word-frequency pairs from `wordCounts` to `sortedWords`.
   - Sorts `sortedWords` in descending order based on word frequency using `std::sort`.

4. **`writeWordCounts()`**:
   - Opens an output file `"output.txt"`.
   - Writes each word and its count to the file, formatted as `"word: count"`.

5. **`writeWordOccurrences()`**:
   - Opens another output file `"lines_output.txt"`.
   - Writes each word followed by the line numbers where it appears, formatted as `"word: line1, line2, ..."`.

### Main Function

- **`int main()`**:
  - Creates an instance of `WordCounter` (`wc`).
  - Calls `writeWordCounts()` to save the word counts to `"output.txt"`.
  - Calls `writeWordOccurrences()` to save the word occurrences to `"lines_output.txt"`.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Reading the File**:
   - The `processFile()` method opens `"input.txt"` and reads it line by line.
   - Each line is processed to extract words using a `std::istringstream`.
   - Words are added to a `std::set` to ensure uniqueness on the current line.
   - The word frequency is updated in `wordCounts`, and line numbers are updated in `wordLines`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - After processing the file, `prepareWordList()` transfers the data from `wordCounts` to `sortedWords`.
   - The `sortedWords` vector is then sorted in descending order of frequency.

3. **Writing Outputs**:
   - `writeWordCounts()` creates a file and writes each word and its frequency.
   - `writeWordOccurrences()` writes each word followed by the sorted list of line numbers where it appears.

### Summary

This program is a simple but effective tool for analyzing text files. It counts how often each word appears, tracks which lines they appear on, and writes both the word counts and line occurrences to separate output files. The use of standard C++ containers (`std::map`, `std::set`, `std::vector`) helps manage and sort the data efficiently.

Certainly! In C++, the headers `<sstream>` and `<algorithm>` provide useful functionality for stream handling and algorithms, respectively. Here’s a detailed explanation of each:

### `<sstream>`

**Purpose**: The `<sstream>` header is used for string stream operations. It allows you to use strings as input or output streams, which is handy for parsing and formatting strings.

**Key Components**:

1. **`std::stringstream`**:
   - This class allows you to perform input and output operations on strings, just like you would with `std::cin` and `std::cout` but using strings instead of actual streams.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     #include <sstream>
     #include <string>
     #include <iostream>

     int main() {
         std::string data = "123 45.67 hello";
         std::stringstream ss(data);

         int intValue;
         float floatValue;
         std::string stringValue;

         ss >> intValue >> floatValue >> stringValue;

         std::cout << "Integer: " << intValue << std::endl;
         std::cout << "Float: " << floatValue << std::endl;
         std::cout << "String: " << stringValue << std::endl;

         return 0;
     }
     ```
   - **Explanation**: Here, `std::stringstream` is used to extract integers, floating-point numbers, and strings from a single string. The `>>` operator works similarly to how it does with `std::cin`.

2. **`std::istringstream`** and **`std::ostringstream`**:
   - `std::istringstream` is used to read from a string.
   - `std::ostringstream` is used to write to a string.
   - These are useful for converting between strings and other data types or for formatting data into strings.

### `<algorithm>`

**Purpose**: The `<algorithm>` header provides a collection of functions for performing common algorithms such as sorting, searching, and manipulating data. These functions operate on containers and ranges, and they are often used with iterators.

**Key Components**:

1. **Sorting**:
   - **`std::sort`**:
     - This function sorts the elements in a range defined by two iterators.
     - **Example**:
       ```cpp
       #include <algorithm>
       #include <vector>
       #include <iostream>

       int main() {
           std::vector<int> numbers = {5, 3, 8, 1, 2};
           std::sort(numbers.begin(), numbers.end());

           for (int num : numbers) {
               std::cout << num << " ";
           }

           return 0;
       }
       ```
     - **Explanation**: `std::sort` arranges the elements in ascending order.

2. **Searching**:
   - **`std::find`**:
     - Searches for a value in a range.
     - **Example**:
       ```cpp
       #include <algorithm>
       #include <vector>
       #include <iostream>

       int main() {
           std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
           auto it = std::find(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), 3);

           if (it != numbers.end()) {
               std::cout << "Found 3 at position: " << (it - numbers.begin()) << std::endl;
           }

           return 0;
       }
       ```
     - **Explanation**: `std::find` searches for the number 3 in the vector and returns an iterator to its position.

3. **Manipulation**:
   - **`std::reverse`**:
     - Reverses the order of elements in a range.
     - **Example**:
       ```cpp
       #include <algorithm>
       #include <vector>
       #include <iostream>

       int main() {
           std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
           std::reverse(numbers.begin(), numbers.end());

           for (int num : numbers) {
               std::cout << num << " ";
           }

           return 0;
       }
       ```
     - **Explanation**: `std::reverse` reverses the order of elements in the vector.

4. **Comparison and Other Utilities**:
   - **`std::max`, `std::min`**: Find the maximum or minimum of two values.
   - **`std::count`**: Counts occurrences of a value in a range.

### Summary

- **`<sstream>`**: Provides classes like `std::stringstream`, `std::istringstream`, and `std::ostringstream` for working with strings as streams. It’s useful for parsing strings and formatting data.

- **`<algorithm>`**: Offers a variety of algorithms for sorting, searching, and manipulating data in containers. Functions like `std::sort`, `std::find`, and `std::reverse` are commonly used for these purposes.

These headers are essential tools in C++ for managing string data and performing common algorithmic operations efficiently.
